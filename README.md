# Classic Snake Game

A simple and fun Snake Game built with Python and Pygame. Navigate the snake to eat food and grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Installation

Before running the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Pygame, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame

Then, you can clone my repository on your local machine using git:

Go ahead and run the game:
python "Snake 33.py"
